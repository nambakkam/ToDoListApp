# ToDoList App

A hobby ToDo List application built with Qt, QML, and C++, implementing MVC and Singleton design patterns.

## Overview

This project is a hobby application developed to demonstrate the practical implementation of software design patterns while creating a functional ToDo List manager. The application leverages Qt's powerful framework along with QML for the user interface and C++ for the backend logic.

## Technologies Used

- C++ & QT
- QML 
- QMake

## Features

- Modern and responsive UI built with QML
- Robust backend implementation in C++
- Implementation of Design Patterns:
  - Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for clean architecture
  - Singleton pattern for resource management

## Project Architecture

### MVC Pattern Implementation
- **Model**: Handles data management and business logic
- **View**: QML-based user interface components
- **Controller**: Manages communication between Model and View

### Singleton Pattern Usage
The Singleton pattern is utilized for managing shared resources and ensuring single instance creation where necessary.

## Prerequisites

- Qt Framework (version 5.12 or higher)
- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later
- Qt Creator IDE (recommended)
